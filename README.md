## Job Weasel

A React-Boilerplate for the Technopathic Full-Stack Web Development series was used for the creation of this site.

This boilerplate includes generators for containers and components. It includes features such as CSS-loading and Styled-Components. React-Icons, React-Responsive, and Material-UI are also included by default for UI/UX design.

## Getting Started
To quickly get started, fork this repo and clone it onto your local computer. Then run `npm install` to install all of the necessary libraries.
```
git clone https://github.com/theClubhouse-Augusta/JobWeasel-FrontEnd
cd JobWeasel-FrontEnd
npm install
```
npm init
npm remote add origin ...

To run the server, simply do `npm run start` and your development website will be on http://localhost:3000.
